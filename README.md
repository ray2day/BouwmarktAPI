# BouwmarktAPI

To my opinion I messed up a previous assignment (see: Bouwmarkt).

Anyhow I'm redoing the assignment at my own pace the upcoming days. So at the moment of writing this readme the code is not finished.
I will program it step by step. Of course each repository commit is working and runnable. This time I have built a separate API, possible to test with Swagger.

I enjoy coding. #Showing myself and future employers I am capable of doing these kind of ASP.NET projects!
