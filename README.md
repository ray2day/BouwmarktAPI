# BouwmarktAPI

To my opinion I messed up a previous assignment (see: Bouwmarkt).

Anyhow, I'm redoing the assignment at my own pace the upcoming days. So at the moment of writing this readme the code is not finished.
I will program it step by step. Of course each repository commit is working and runnable. This time I have built a separate API, possible to test with Swagger.

Access to Koopzondagen-database / Vestiging-table use following commands;

<b>GET</b>
/api/Vestiging

<b>GET (by id)</b>
/api/Vestiging/{id}

<b>POST</b>
/api/Vestiging

<b>PUT</b>
/api/Vestiging

<b>DELETE</b>
/api/Vestiging/{id}

I enjoy coding. #Showing myself and future employers I am capable of doing these kind of ASP.NET projects!
