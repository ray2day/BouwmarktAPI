# BouwmarktAPI

To my opinion I really messed up my previous assignment (see: Bouwmarkt).

Anyhow I'm redoing the assignment at my own pace the upcoming days. So at the moment of writing this code  also not finished yet!
I will code it step by step. Of course each repository commit is woeking and runnable. And this time it is possible to test the API with Swagger.

I enjoy coding. - Showing myself and future employers I am capable of doing these kind of ASP.NET projects!
